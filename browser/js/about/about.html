	      Since the <strong>Great Awakening</strong>, dreams have proven rare and elusive. Starting on that fateful day, we have stopped being able to close our eyes at night and have our heads filled with brilliant stories, glimpses of the future or insight into out present.

	      Everybody knows someone who has sought out an illicit dream on the black market and become trapped in their own imaginings, unable to wake up or been driven mad by their visions, no longer trusting sleep.
